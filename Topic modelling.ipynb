    "Topic modelling is the process of grouping large volumes of text into *topics*, that is collections of texts that align in the words that they use. At the conceptual level, topic modelling tries to cluster representations of the texts based on some similarity metric. As a result, there are many different approaches and techniques for topic modelling.\n",

These representative words and docs are typically enough to characterise the largest topics.\n",

Normally, we can avoid these issues with topic size by considering only the largest topics for subsequent analysis, such as the top 10.\n",

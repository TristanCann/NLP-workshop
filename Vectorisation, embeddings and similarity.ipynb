    "There are a few points to note about bag of words representations. Firstly, the representation is typically quite sparse, that is most entries in the array are `0`, which means that most headlines only use a few words in the corpus. It's also rare for any of the entries to be greater than `1` - this is a feature of choosing short headlines as our corpus. The last issue to consider is we lose all relationship between words besides appearing in the same headline - we don't know if words are consecutive or at either end of the text. This vectorisation does allow us to quickly compare texts for linguistic overlap however.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next embedding technique we're going to look at is called term frequency-inverse document frequency (`TF-IDF`). TF-IDF is a great way to compare texts and identify which words are more important to a text. It does this be normalising the term frequency calculated in the bag of words representation by the inverse document frequency ('IDF'). The IDF is a measure of how common a term is across all the text you're comparing. By adding this factor, we penalise terms that are common to many text as we expect their frequency to be naturally higher. We calculate this representation in a similar way. "

    "There are a few pros and cons to be aware of with text embeddings. Since the model we're applying to the embeddings, adding new data is easy and only needs computation on the new data (compared to TF-IDF which needs the IDF values to be updated). In addition, the notion of semantic similarity in this space makes it easier to compare the meaning of texts. The drawbacks to embeddings come in the representation. Unlike the bag of words and TF-IDF representations, BERT embeddings are data dense and can therefore become large for significant corpora. The dimensions of the vector space are also removed from the underlying meaning of the words - they are instead *latent* dimensions that collect the relevance of many underlying words.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other caveat to note is that some BERT models have limits to the length of text that they accept as an input. You may not encounter this with your data, but be aware that splitting longer texts may give more reliable measures of the semantic information in the text - the examples here are *sentence transformers*, designed to work on shorter texts.\n",
